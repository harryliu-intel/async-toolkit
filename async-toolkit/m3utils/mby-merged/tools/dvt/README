About DVT 

DVT (Distributed Validation Toolkit) is a framework for platform validation using co-simulation of multiple
RTL models and testbenches in a distributed manner. It integrates with leading RTL simulators
(Synopsys VCS, Mentor ModelSim) and custom C/C++ applications, and provides capabilities for their communication,
synchronization, and simulation control.
