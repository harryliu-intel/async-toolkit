Area for Collage

Collage is an SoC Integration system, focused on efficient IP reuse and SoC RTL integration. Collage provides a 
top-down approach to IP integration based on modular and configurable IPs. Collage is built around coreTools (from Synopsys) 
for IP packaging and integration, and Intel SoC Front-End and Back-End flows. Collage also enables derived collateral 
generation (ACE, testbench, UPF, etc.) delivered through the Chassis Sandbox packages.
