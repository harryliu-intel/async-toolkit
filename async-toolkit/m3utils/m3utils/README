m3build/m3ship are a bit tricky to deal with.

To get m3ship to install things where you want them to go, use
PKG_INSTALL="dest dir"

Remember to check if build_standalone is necessary if you're not
going to m3ship to /usr/local.

This all needs to be set up so that we can "build" a final version
or a working version w/o clobbering /usr/local...
