Indeed! I missed that...
I emphatically believe/agree that tools should be installed as

tool-version

-not-

tool-date-changenumber

Right.
Counterproposal:
/usr/local/fulcrum/[bin|pdk|config] : as discussed
/usr/local/fulcrum/tools/
/usr/local/fulcrum/tools/<tool>-nightly/
/usr/local/fulcrum/tools/<tool>-version.release/
                    ...

This is more in line with how we install other 'normal' software.

Re: PowerPC, I was asking where it came from that Mike listed it as a 
required architecture? I suspect it was Patrick and Andrew wanting to 
run things natively on their laptops, but I don't believe there's been 
any formal discussion of what would be required to properly support it.
