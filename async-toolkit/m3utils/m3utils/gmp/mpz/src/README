Where the sources come from...

build_glue.sh builds several of the files. They are checked in, just
because.

No manual intervention should be needed to re-build, though.

Run off gmp.h .

NOTE that this library may need to be bootstrapped, since cspc depends
on it (indirectly), and building it depends on cspc, if we need to
re-run make-mpz.
