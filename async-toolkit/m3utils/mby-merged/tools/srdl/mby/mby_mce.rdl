// MCE table [0..32767] [0..256] 257 bits, 256 bits port, 1 bit for virtual port
// This table will be accessed by software as follows
// Command bit [0] =  '0' = read, '1' = write 
// Go bit [0] =  '1' means hardware execute the command, single tone bit, generates a pulse to hardware
// Address [15:0] , pointing to entry
// Done bit -- hardware writes it, software reads it.
// Each new command, hardware resets the Done bit. After executing the command, hw sets the done bit
// WrData Register[0..8] = Total 258 bits bits 257 = parity bit, 256:0 = Data bits
// RdData Register[0..8] = Total 258 bits bits 257 = parity bit, 256:0 = Data bits

// Flow will be as below. 
// SW wants to update the entry #135 with 257 bits value, parity bit = 258, 
// SW writes in data reg [0..8]
// SW write in Address[15:0] = 0x
// SW writes Command = '1'
