Synthesis
---------
1) Synthesize tmpl_dut 

    command:  
        make syn

    inputs:
       cfg/rtl_list.tcl 
        - generated by this command:  make run_test_short
       cfg/unit_syn.clocks.tbl
        - can specify clock frequency in this file
       cfg/unit_syn.io.tbl

    more information:
        - see syn: line in scripts/Makefile

Exploring Synthesis Results via Text Files 
------------------------------------------
Overview

    This section gives just a brief explanation of the synthesis results directory
    Included is a few file descriptions that will assist in debugging errant runs
    
Actual synthesis directory where all the work takes place
	<BLOCK>-be/syn


	Here's what a successful example looked like, for BLOCK=apr_cport_pif_shim:
	apr_cport_pif_shim-be/syn> 

		  ##Feb-07-13:57:49#.sccj002780*
		   	This is the netbatch run log for the job... this should be familiar to you
		  WORK/
		   	This is a Synopsys working directory... don't ever worry about this one
				if you end up debugging a run, leave this investigation to the PD group or the AE
		  alib-52/
		   	This directory holds the libraries used during the synthesis.
				Useful to know in the event that you have some missing cell, timing arc, etc warnings/errors/messages 
		  
		   	<BLOCK>.rdt_attributes.txt  (apr_cport_pif_shim.rdt_attributes.txt)
		   	This file is extremely useful in the event your synthesis run doesn't complete.
				It details the sequeunce of PD flow  steps that are being executed and successfully completed.
				In a failure, the exact proc experiencing a meltdown will be intuitively obvious
			
		  filenames_25769_D20180207.log
		   	This contains the list of all files used/referenced by the tool
				Also very valuable
				
		  inputs/
		   	This looks important, but it's not
				
		  logs/
		   	This directory is actually what it looks like, a directory of log files.
				There are too many to try and explain each one in detail, but here are the important points:
				1. output.log: this is the log of the run and should be identical, as far as I know, of the netbatch log file
				2. RDT.[pass|fail].<step name>  : this is the RDT (PD flow) official success/failure file for the steps executed.
															  There should be a very strong correlation to the <BLOCK>.rdt_attributes.txt 
				3. <BLOCK>.<step>.[log|done.log|log.done.sum|log.sum] 
					Theses files should be the log output from the RDT flow for each step 
					There should be a very strong correlation to the <BLOCK>.rdt_attributes.txt
					
		  outputs/
		   	This is the outputs directory of the synthesis run... i.e. verilog netlists and other design views
		  reports/
		   	See the below special section on the reports directory:
		  scripts/ : 
			  this directory will hole the block_setup.tcl file that can be used to modify the RDT settings for tuning the synthesis run for your particular block.
			  It's the user override for the block.
		  synopsys_cache/


There are various reports files... 
There's a set written for each stage, so I only listed the syn_final reports.
I've broken them down into some general categories.
If you need help reading or interpreting these, please wait for an upcoming training material for this.

	Timing Reports
		reports/apr_cport_pif_shim.syn_final.report_timing.max
		reports/apr_cport_pif_shim.syn_final.report_timing.max.sum
		reports/apr_cport_pif_shim.syn_final.check_design
		reports/apr_cport_pif_shim.syn_final.io_clock_report.func
		reports/apr_cport_pif_shim.syn_final.path_groups.rpt
		reports/apr_cport_pif_shim.syn_final.percent_cell_net_delay
		reports/apr_cport_pif_shim.syn_final.histogram
			This file is related to the timing path groups
		reports/apr_cport_pif_shim.syn_final.high_fanout_net

	Design information

		reports/apr_cport_pif_shim.syn_final.design_qor

	RDT Variables report
		reports/apr_cport_pif_shim.syn_final.G_variables_list
			a list of RDT (PD flow) variables and their settings/values

Exploring Synthesis Results with GUI 
------------------------------------

1) Load synthesis results and start phys design graphical user interface

    command:
        make physgui

2) open layout window
        
    GUI operations:
         i)   select menu item: Window->New Layout Window

3) show standard cells in layout window

    GUI operations:
        i)   in "LayoutWindow.1" that pops up, display and allow selection of standard cells by clicking on +Cell in "Objects" tab on the left
        ii)  click on both boxes by "Standard"
        iii) click the "Apply Button" above

4) turn on flylines (straight lines to connected cells) viewing for selected cells 

    GUI operations:
        i)   View->Flylines
       
5) select some cells with mouse
        
    GUI operations:
        i)  click->drag->unclick to draw a box around cells you want to select
        ii) alternatively, click on an individual cell

6) highlight some specified cells  
        
    command: (type at dc_shell-topo> prompt in either terminal where make physgui was run or GUI windows)
        source ../../../../../scripts/highlight.tcl

    more information: 
        - see scripts/highlight.tcl for actual commands
        - these commands can be typed in the same places as the "source" command

7) select some specified cells (in this case, the data path)

    command: (type at dc_shell-topo> prompt in either terminal where make physgui was run or GUI windows)
        source ../../../../../scripts/select_dp.tcl

    more information:
        - see scripts/select_dp.tcl
        - these commands can be typed in the same places as the "source" command


8) open timing window

    GUI operations:
        i)   (FIXME:  say which window) select menu item:  Timing->Timing Analysis Driver
        ii)  click <OK> on "Select Paths" window that pops up
        iii) expand "TimingAnalysisDriver.1" window by clicking on square-like icon in upper right corner of this window 

9) show timing path(s) in GUI

    GUI operations:
        i) in "TimingAnalysisDriver.1" window, click on one of the rows or click->drag->unclick to select multiple rows.  

    more information:
        The selected timing paths should be highlighed in "LayoutWindow.1"
