Hello, $userfirstname$
  You submitted change list #$changenum$.  Change list #$changenum$
fixed the $buildname$ build. The $buildname$ build had been broken by 
change list #$brokenchangenum$, which was submitted by you.
You don't deserve a cookie, because you should not have broken the build
in the first place.

Sincerely,
  The Build User
