package switch_wm

/** Provides classes and associated objects for interfacing the configuration and status registers
  *
  * ==Overview==
  * There are two categories of classes/objects in this package. The majority of these are derived from the
  * RDL structure of the design. These are created with the 'genviews' tools within the M3 directory (the
  * parser is written in Modula-3).
  *
  * Other classes and objects are human-written to support these classes and provide elegant mechanisms
  * for using them.
