Files for Coverage Aggregation and Storage Application (CASA)

CASA is a tool for aggregating coverage results (i.e. *.vdb) from test runs, and generating periodical coverage reports based on various criteria (e.g. test template).

CASA enables aggregation of functional coverage results from VCS  vdb databases as well as JEM (emulation) results

Multiple vdb results are merged through URG and represented in a results tree which can support multiple levels of results hierarchy (project, DUT, stepping, scope, date)

Analysis of coverage results is done using Verdi3
