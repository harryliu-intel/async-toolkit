m3build/m3ship are a bit tricky to deal with.

To get m3ship to install things where you want them to go, use
PKG_INSTALL="dest dir"

Remember to check if build_standalone is necessary if you're not
going to m3ship to /usr/local.

To distribute just part of this repository, just delete the directories
you don't want to distribute.  The dirsexist.sh shell script will make
sure that only the right things are built.
