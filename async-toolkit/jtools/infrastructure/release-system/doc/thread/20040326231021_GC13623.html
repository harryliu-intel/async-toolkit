Davies snuck it into
http://internal/eng/depot/sw/infrastructure/release-system/main/doc/index.html
Look under the Packages section.  "Three platforms will be supported":
Linux-i686, SunOS-sun4u, and Darwin-powerpc.

with a changelist number in the single line of development.  There
doesn't seem to be any place different branches to go.

Well, we need a place to put 1.1, 1.1.1, 1.2, etc.
