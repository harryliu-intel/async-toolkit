Sandbox TB usage:
    make          # Build simulator and run test
    make build    # Build simulator
    make run      # Build simulator (only if necessary) and run test
    make clean    # Remove generated build and run-related files in this directory

To add build and run flags:
    Method 1 - in Makefiles:
        BASEVCSFLAGS += <FLAGS>
        BASERUNFLAGS += <FLAGS>
    Method 2 - on make command line:
        VCSFLAGS="<FLAGS>" RUNFLAGS="<FLAGS>"

Environment setup:
    Handled by setup script in this directory, which is invoked automatically by the Makefile
