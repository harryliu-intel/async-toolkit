This is a general TCAM model for use in MBY. For implementation details, please see Tcam.i3. TCAMs can be found in some of the following parts of MBY:
- Wildcard Match (WCM) Groups contain 1024 entry TCAM slices. The number of slices per group can vary. These groups may also use non-trivial chunk masks.
- The Programmable Parser Engine (PPE) contains a 64 entry TCAM named PARSER_PTYPE_TCAM.
- The domain mapper contains a 4096 entry TCAM called MAP_DOMAIN_TCAM.
- The packet profile TCAM contains 96 entries.

The TCAM is compiled as a library and linked to form any WM executable. This way, 

TODOs:
- More descriptive exception messages for Thread.Alerted and Wr.Failure errors
- Variable bit length of TCAM entries. Right now it is set to 40-bits, which is the length of the WCM groups' TCAM slices.
- A way to protect the user from changing values in the Tcam.TcamSlice record, almost like private variables
- Possible some READNLYs in function args to give the user a sense of safety whenever possible
- A better, more extensible test suite
