Templates Directory

The contents of this directory are installation target identifiers.

TARGET ID		REPOSITORY

wm			The White Model repository

The directory structure under the target id directory is a replica of the path 
to the file in the respective repository.  This path is used to:
- Identify files uniquely (same name, different path)
- Make it easy to identify which template/view to edit when making a change
- Which files are generated from this content in a repository
- Install the files in the proper location.
