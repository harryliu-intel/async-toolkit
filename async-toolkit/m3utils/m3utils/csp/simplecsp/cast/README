This directory contains test examples for the CSP compiler.

The *.il sub-directories hold intermediate language forms generated by
the front-end and are provided as examples, demonstrating the format of
the intermediate form's syntax.

The front-end itself is not included here but in the Java companion
distribution.

The src sub-directory contains a hand-compiled example, showing the
general approach taken in the compiler.
