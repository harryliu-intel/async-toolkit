Directory Tree Contents
-----------------------
  * a fast Makefile based build/sim/debug flow    (dir: ., scripts) 
  * a reference testbench design                  (dir: ./verilog) 
    that validates the reference logic design     (dir: ../../verilog)
  * an example testcase                           (dir: tests)

Purpose
-------
  * Model and teach good design and coding practices via illustration and comments
  * Provide a working playground to try out various flows
  * Provide a starting point or capabilities that can be leveraged in any design
