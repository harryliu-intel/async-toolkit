This is the XML Parse library.  It's a simple Modula-3 wrapper over
the C expat library.

You'll need: 

expat installed
expat.h header file in /usr/local/include

Because of "features" in the Modula-3 compiler system, the header
file must be in /usr/local/include.  If it's not, you have to edit
xmlParse.c .

Only the most basic expat features are supported right now, and not
well.  Feel free to improve the software.
