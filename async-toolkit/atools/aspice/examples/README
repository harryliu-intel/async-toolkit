ASPICE RELEASE 0.1 -- Examples

Some examples are included.  Generally if you find file.asp and
file.in, you would execute "aspice -path aspice_path file < file.in".
Once it has produced a file.trace and file.names, you can plot
waveforms with "aplot file".  You should set the aspice_path argument
(or ASPICE_PATH env variable) to point to the tech.asp and default.asp
files in the asp subdirectory, as well as a BSIM4 model deck.  Some of
these examples use the TSMC 0.13um LV BSIM3 deck, which you need to
get from TSMC directly due to licensing issues.  Or edit tech.asp to
point to a different BSIM4 deck.
