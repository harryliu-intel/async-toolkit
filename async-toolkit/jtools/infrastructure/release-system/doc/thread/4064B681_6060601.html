Where did this requirement for PowerPC support come from?
Was there a discussion?
It's more likely that we'll need to support Linux/AMD (or other 64-bit 
Linux) in the not-very-distant future.

I agree. If it's the nightly build, let's just call it 'nightly'.

It's my understanding that the plan already includes the ability for a 
particular project to stick with whatever tool releases they wish (by 
adjusting their project-specific config files). Once we release the v1.1 
tools into this structure, Nevada could keep using them even when Tahoe 
switches to v1.5 (or v2.0), and patches could be applied when needed 
against that older version without interfering with any other versions.
Downside: an important patch may need to be applied to all active versions.

The whole 'how to branch' discussion seems (to me) to be an issue 
internal to a particular tools' development team. Whichever method gets 
chosen for a particular tool shouldn't effect me, /usr/local/fulcrum, or 
this plan.
