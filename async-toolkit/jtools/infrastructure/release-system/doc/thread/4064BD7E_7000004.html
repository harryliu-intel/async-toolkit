Keep up the discussion.

One additional point on /usr/local/fulcrum is this: Are we considering
the fact that the tools and the pdk, for example, are highly cross 
dependent... in other words, updates
to the pdk can affect tools and tool improvements may require changes to 
the pdk. Therefore,
they really cannot be released separately without some serious cross 
checking by the tool
for compatibility.
