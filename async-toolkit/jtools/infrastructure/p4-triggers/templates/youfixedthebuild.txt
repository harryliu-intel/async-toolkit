Hello, $userfirstname$
  You submitted change list #$changenum$.  Change list #$changenum$
fixed the $buildname$ build. The $buildname$ build had been broken by 
change list #$brokenchangenum$, which was submitted by $brokenuserfullname$ ( $brokenuser$ ).
You deserve a cookie.  You should go steal one from $brokenuserfirstname$.

Sincerely,
  The Build User
