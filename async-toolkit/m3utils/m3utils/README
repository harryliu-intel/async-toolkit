m3build/m3ship are a bit tricky to deal with.

To get m3ship to install things where you want them to go, use
PKG_INSTALL="dest dir"

Remember to check if build_standalone is necessary if you're not
going to m3ship to /usr/local.

To distribute just part of this repository, just delete the directories
you don't want to distribute.  The dirsexist.sh shell script will make
sure that only the right things are built.


Any pared down version of the repository needs the following files and
directories at the top level in order for packages using cit_util to work:

- Makefile  
- cit_common
- cit_util
- dirsexist.sh
- hack
- m3overrides
- m3subdir.mk
- m3tmplhack
