Files for Spyglass Low Power lint analysis

See: https://securewiki.ith.intel.com/display/hdk/Lint+for+Low+Power

Most low power designs need to use multiple voltage/power domains for power optimization. The use of 
multiple voltage domains requires signals that cross the voltage domain boundaries are level-shifted appropriately. 
The use of power domains requires that certain signals are isolated correctly under power-down condition. 
RTL Low Power Lint checks provide low-power rules and design techniques to address multiple voltage domains, and 
power-down regions that may be present in a typical low power design. The HDK POR methodology is to describe power 
intent using UPF (Unified Power Format), with no power macro/net/signal in RTL.

Spyglass is an RTL analysis tool from Atrenta. Spyglass-LP analyzes RTL and UPF against a set of rules. Basic Spyglass 
rules get auto-run before the power checks. The low power checks include rules covering the UPF format/spec, isolation 
logic, level shifters, state retention, feed throughs, etc.
