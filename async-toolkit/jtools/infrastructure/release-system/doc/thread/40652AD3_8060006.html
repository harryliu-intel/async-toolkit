As I proposed in my last email, we should have both the version and the 
"date-changenum" in each package file.  I do agree that each branch's 
directory should be named "tool-version".

Having "<tool>-nightly" and "<tool>-version.release" as peers doesn't 
really work since "version.release" refers to a particular branch, and 
each branch will have its own nightly builds.

True, there hasn't been any "formal discussion" regarding support for 
Darwin-powerpc.  My feeling is that if we can work out a simple way to 
cross-compile for the Mac, then let's include the platform in all 
nightly package builds (with no regression testing as I mentioned 
earlier.)  If we can't cross-compile, then Andrew, Patrick, or I will 
undoubtedly eventually figure out how to build our own packages locally 
on our laptops, and we will grudgingly maintain our own local release trees.
