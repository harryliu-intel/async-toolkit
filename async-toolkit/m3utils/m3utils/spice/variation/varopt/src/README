Variation optimizer/pessimizer program

Example command lines: look in *.sh files in this directory

preliminary results are in the RESULTS* files

The general approach is to run this program to pessimize the circuit under study.  THEN, do whatever is necessary to add the pessimized circuit to the techc technology comparison program.  For an example, see commit 28b08ebdc61b26c48d935e1e5aacf14d983bb99d in this repo.

If you want to run through a feeder, do e.g.

   setenv NBRUNOPTIONS "--target sccf034907 --task 20"

where --target is a host where the feeder is running and --task points to an existing task number (which can have limits on # of jobs etc)
