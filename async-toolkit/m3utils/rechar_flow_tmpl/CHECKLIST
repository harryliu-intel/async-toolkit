1. make sure you're in cth2 and the WARD is correct

2. make sure that you started cth2 with the correct PDK settings.

two examples:

1278p3 0p5 PDK:

# /p/hdk/bin/cth_psetup -p ipde/2023.16.04 -cfg 78p3_opt9_r05.cth -nowash -tool ipde_all -x '$SETUP_IPDE'

1278p3 0p8 PDK:

# /p/hdk/bin/cth_psetup -p ipde/2023.31.02.p2 -cfg 78p3_opt12_r08.cth -nowash -tool ipde_all -x '$SETUP_IPDE'

as of 8/23 we are using the latter for FWR.

cth2 must be started in the top-level dir.


NEW FLOW 12/6/2023:

create a setup.* file with a memorable name.  The setup file should
define four variables and then call (source) do_setup.sh, for example:

#!/bin/sh

cells=cell_list.tc2
workdir=siliconsmart.tc2
env=env.zsh.0p9eu1
pvts=pvts.zsh.300_85_cmin

. ./do_setup.sh


each of the lines points at a file in the CWD, which should exist and
should be in the git repository.  If it does not already exist, create it and
add it to git.  

Then add this the setup file itself to git.

Then run the setup file.  This will create the proper symlinks. 

2b. make sure SP variables are set correctly if doing asfit (4 vars)
    -- check them for matching PDK in any case, even if not doing asfit!
   (check for them in env.zsh)

2c. if doing asfit, worry about the extraction quality between the cell data
from the standard cell library and the UPF being used for simulation.

3. make sure siliconsmart dir exists and is empty (check symlink):

create appropriately named work directory, e.g.,

rm siliconsmart # assuming siliconsmart is a symlink
rm -rf siliconsmart.mine
mkdir siliconsmart.mine
ln -sf siliconsmart.mine siliconsmart

"siliconsmart" MUST point to an empty directory (or BE an empty directory)

4. check env.zsh for stdcell_dir -- should match desired starting lib

5. check env.zsh for SILICONSMART_ROOT_DIR -- should match WARD!  (This is automatic now.)

6. check cell_list for being correct---cell_list can be a symlink (rec'm'd)

7. if doing spcl cells, make sure the required special cell is included:

(in 1278.3)

spcl_ulvt i0sddtih0aa1d02x5
spcl_ulvt i0sddtil0aa1d02x5

spcl_lvt i0sddtih0ab1d02x5
spcl_lvt i0sddtil0ab1d02x5

etc (this "trick" fixes up various power rails)

8. check runme / pvts.zsh for correct temp and voltage(s)
  8a.  Make sure corners exist in the run_postprocess script!

9. For parallel runs, you must have M3UTILS set, e.g.,

setenv M3UTILS /nfs/site/disks/zsc9_fwr_sd_001/mnystroe/m3utils

The dependency is on the sislaunch program for parallel runs.  Parallel runs
can also be disabled in env.zsh (that will not completely disable parallelism,
but will reduce performance especially for runs consisting of a small number
of cells in a large number of bundles).

10. LAUNCH:

./runme cell_list |& tee runme.mine.log

---- WAIT A LONG TIME ----

11. while you are waiting:

cd siliconsmart
ls -ltra
cd <most recent PVT dir>
ls -ltra
cd <most recent bundle dir>
tail -f siliconsmart.log

if a job gets STUCK (sits several hours with a single worker), use

nbstatus jobs

figure out where it is running; log in to that machine; kill the siliconsmart process there

the master siliconsmart process will figure out to relaunch the job.

12. If anything goes wrong, fix it.  It is allowable to, e.g., cut back PVTs
or bundles.

13. In case of fixes, can rebundle the final bundles using

./runme_final cell_list

Note that ./runme_final is called from a specific point in the runme script.
Please read the scripts to understand what is happening so that runme_final
is starting in an appropriate environment.

14. In case of splitting the flow (doing runme in one place and
runme_final separately), which is OK to do, ensure that the files are
set up right!  Pay special attention to PVTs and env.zsh contents!  Plus
make sure that the CTH2 setup matches in the two runs.

----  BASIC QC  ----

pushd siliconsmart/bundles

zgrep i0s */lib/lib783_i0s_160h_50pp_*_*${PVT}*.lib.gz | grep "cell.i0s" | sed -e 's/.*cell.//' -e 's/).*//' > ../../cells_done

popd

awk '{print $2}' cell_list > cells_reqd
cat cells_reqd cells_reqd cells_done | sort | uniq -c | sort -g | less

2 means : requested but not done
1 means : done but not requested
3 means : requested and done

Also run ./checkmissing.sh
