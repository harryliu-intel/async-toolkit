Older revision history is in the Barefoot m3utils repo, directory "lamb".

In order to use this code, you will need a working checkout of m3utils.  See https://github.com/intel-sandbox/m3utils

Characterization also depends on Andrew Lines's / andrew.lines@intel.com / "aplot" plotting program.

See the top-level Makefile to set up links to these tools as necessary.
