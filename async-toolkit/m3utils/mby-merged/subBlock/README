Directory: subBlock

The subBlock directory should contains only subdirectories for IP that are part of this IP.
Each subBlock directory should replicate the top-level directory structure as needed.
Blocks should be put in the subBlock directory if the project wishes to do something to
them separately from the complete IP, i.e. simulation, synthesis, CDC, etc.

If the project does not want to do something to a design subblock separately from the IP,
it can be put under <root>/src/<ip-name>/rtl instead of subBlock.
