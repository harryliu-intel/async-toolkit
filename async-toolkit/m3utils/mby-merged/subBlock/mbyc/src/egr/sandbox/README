# EGR Sandbox usage:

# Build the sandbox model and run the GK gate test case.
# Removes all temporary files, leaving only build and run logs.
make gate           # Build sandbox for EGR Top
make gate dut=<dut> # Build sandbox for <dut> e.g. dut=prc, dut=tqu, etc.

# Build the sandbox model and run the GK gate test case.
# Generates a trace and leaves all temp files.
make debug           # Build sandbox for EGR Top
make debug dut=<dut> # Build sandbox for <dut> e.g. dut=prc, dut=tqu, etc.

# Build the model without running a test
make simv           # Build model for EGR Top
make simv dut=<dut> # Build model for <dut> e.g. dut=prc, dut=tqu, etc.

# Clean up all generated files, including logs and traces
make clean

# Open DVE to view a trace
make dve

# Note: "make <command> dut=<dut>" assumes testbench is on the path egr/partition1/<dut>/sandbox/rtl/<dut>_tb.sv
