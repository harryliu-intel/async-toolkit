If you want to use a different compiler toolchain (developing changes to such toolchain, for example):

Make sure META_ROOT in the Makefile is set right.
Make sure CM3 in the Makefile is set right.
And make sure you setnhdk -w to the current clone.

And make sure CM3_HOME is correct in the meta repo!
