<h2>Release System Plan</h2>
<ol>
<li>Change or make new package build script to build packages according to change number.
<blockquote>
5/12: experimental version works but not complete.<br>
5/18: completed changes to allow build concurrently in non-conflicting locations as well
as other misc. improvements.
5/20: Discovered major issues in building PDKs, still unresolved.
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>Change or make new package install script to install packages into /usr/local/fulcrum according to change number.
<blockquote>
5/12: experimental version works but not complete.<br>
5/19: Fixed issues with build system such that this is no longer required.<br>
</blockquote>
</li>
